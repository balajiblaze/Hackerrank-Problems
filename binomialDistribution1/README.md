Binomial Distribution #1
========================

A blindfolded marksman finds that on the average he hits the target 4 times out of 5. If he fires 4 shots, what is the probability of

(a) more than 2 hits?  
(b) at least 3 misses?  

Submission Modes and Output Format
----------------------------------

You may submit either an R or Python program to accomplish the above task, or solve the problem on pen-and-paper. Your output should be two floating point/decimal numbers separated by a line, correct to 3 places of decimal.

* In the text box below, enter two floating point/decimal numbers, correct to 3 places of decimal.
* Alternatively, you may submit an R program, which uses the above parameters (hard-coded) and computes the answer.

Your answer should resemble something like:

0.123  
0.456  

(This is NOT the answer, just a demonstration of what the answering format should resemble).
